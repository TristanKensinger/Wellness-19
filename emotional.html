                Emotions are a very important aspect of living life indoors. We often find ourselves getting down just sitting around the house.
                Below are some good strategies that might help you bring your emotional level to a happier state.

            <h1><u>Getting Funky With It</u></h1>
            <p>
               One of the easiest ways to make yourself happier is to dance. It has been scientifically proven that listening to canned heat and 
               showing off your best dance moves makes you happier. Thats why the people behind Wellness-19 have linked the video here.

            <h1><u>Bob Ross</u></h1>
            <p>
                Another brilliant way to cheer yourself up is to binge watch the Joy of Painting Series by Bob Ross. Bob Ross is the master at
                making people feel better. The way he paints the happy little clouds and gives every little tree a friend can make anyone smile.
                We encourage you to give it a watch, and if you already watched it before, watch it again for good measure.

            <h1><u>Trying to Stay Positive</u></h1>
            <p>
                All jokes aside, your emotional state is one of the most important parts of your wellness. Happiness is not a destination that 
                one can simply arrive at. Happiness is more like a muscle that needs to be excercised regularly. Make sure to do things that you
                enjoy everyday. It may be hard to stay positive and motivated to do even the littlest things, but just remember that you are not alone.
                If you ever need someone to talk to make sure to reach out. We linked a website called 7 cups which allows people to talk to real people
                about anything. If you feel lonely make sure to give it a try.
