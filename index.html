                Everyone is aware these are challenging times. Between social distancing, having to wear face coverings, and friends and 
                family getting sick, it can be difficult to take care of yourself. Many of us find ourselves struggling to stay happy, healthy, 
                and motivated through this pandemic, even if we test negative. Wellness is defined as the state of being in good health.
                Many people break the topic of wellness down into smaller components. Wellness-19 focuses on the main 5 personal components 
                which are as follows: emotional, physical, spiritual, intellectual, and social. Although life may seem as if it is at a 
                stand still, our personal happiness does not have to also pause. Wellness-19â€™s goal is to bring hope into every home across 
                the world through the various resources provided on our site, categorized by each of the above facets of wellness. From our family to yours, we wish you health and happiness. Be well.
