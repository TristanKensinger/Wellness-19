            <p>
                Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, 
                thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
                Many people meditate to ground themselves and feel more connected to the present. Many people claim that meditation can boost
                one's spirituality and restore happiness and motivation. Mindful.org offers guidance on how to begin meditating.
