            <p>
                Core exercises train the muscles in your pelvis, lower back, hips and abdomen to work in harmony. This leads to better 
                balance and stability, whether on the playing field or in daily activities. In fact, most sports and other physical 
                activities depend on stable core muscles. We linked a good workout for your core.
